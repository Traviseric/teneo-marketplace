# 📚 Teneo Marketplace - The All-in-One Platform for Free Thinkers

**Website. Store. Courses. Email Marketing. All with built-in censorship resistance.**

The only all-in-one platform designed for creators who value freedom. Like Podia, but with automatic failover to crypto payments + offshore hosting when you get deplatformed. Open source, federated, and impossible to shut down.

## ⚡ **What Makes This Different**

### 🛡️ **Censorship Resistance** (Unique to Us)

**Dual-Mode Operation:**
- **PRIMARY MODE**: Stripe checkout, mainstream hosting, easy UX
- **FALLBACK MODE**: Crypto payments, offshore VPS, Tor backup
- **AUTOMATIC FAILOVER**: Switches modes when primary is taken down

**When Podia/Shopify/Gumroad ban you → You're done.**
**When Stripe bans you on Teneo → Automatically switches to Bitcoin. You stay online.**

### 🌐 **Federated Network** (Unique to Us)
- **OPEN SOURCE**: Anyone can deploy their own marketplace node
- **CROSS-NODE DISCOVERY**: Find products across the entire network
- **REVENUE SHARING**: Nodes earn 10-20% referral fees
- **DISTRIBUTED**: Can't shut down a network of 100+ independent nodes

### 💰 **Pricing That Actually Makes Sense**

| Feature | Podia | Teneo Marketplace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Price** | $39/month | **FREE** (self-hosted) or $29/month (hosted) |
| Website Builder | ✅ | ✅ + AI customization |
| Online Store | ✅ | ✅ + Crypto payments |
| Email Marketing | ✅ | ✅ |
| Courses | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Censorship Resistance** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Federation** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Open Source** | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **API Testing**
```bash
# Health check
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/health"

# Get community stats
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/published/stats"

# Get books with filtering
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/published/books?sort=best_bsr&limit=5"

# Get publisher leaderboards
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/published/leaderboards"
```

### **Authentic Data Approach**
**🎯 Quality Over Fake Quantity**: This marketplace prioritizes authentic data over fabricated success stories.

**Real Data Only**:
- Only genuine Teneo-generated books are featured
- Real Amazon ASINs with actual performance metrics
- Authentic publisher profiles and achievements
- No fake sample data or misleading representations

**Setup**:
```bash
# Initialize with authentic data
cd marketplace/backend/scripts
node create-real-data.js
```

**Empty State Design**: When no books are submitted, the marketplace shows inspiring empty states encouraging real user participation rather than fake data.
