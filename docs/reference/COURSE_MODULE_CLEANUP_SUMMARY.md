## ⚠️ Action Items (For You)

### **Immediate:**
1. **Review Changes** - Read the updated files to confirm they match your vision
2. **Create Missing Lesson** - `lessons/m0-l2-modern-advantage.md` is referenced but doesn't exist yet
3. **Update Video File** - If `m0-l2-teneo.mp4` exists, rename to `m0-l2-modern.mp4`

### **Before Committing:**
4. **Review Other Lessons** - Check modules 1-4 for any remaining Teneo references
5. **Test Course Player** - Ensure updated content displays correctly
6. **Run Brand Check** - Search for any remaining "Teneo" mentions

```bash
# Quick brand check
grep -r "Teneo" course-module/ --exclude="*.md"  # Should return nothing
grep -r "proprietary" course-module/             # Should return nothing
```

### **Optional (For Private Repo):**
7. **Maintain Teneo-Branded Version** - Keep original content in `teneo-production`
8. **Create Branding Script** - Automate adding Teneo branding when publishing

---

## 🚀 What This Enables

### **1. Open Source Release**
- ✅ No proprietary branding in public code
- ✅ Community can contribute without legal concerns
- ✅ Educational value is universal

### **2. Federation Network**
- ✅ Partners can white-label the platform

### **3. Competitive Protection**

- ✅ Teneo Engine generation logic (private in teneo-production)
- ✅ Clear separation of IP

### **4. Community Growth**
- ✅ Contributors can improve course player UI
- ✅ Generic content attracts more users
- ✅ Network effects benefit everyone

## 💡 Pro Tip: Maintaining Both Versions

If you want to maintain both generic (public) and Teneo-branded (private) versions:

### **In teneo-production (Private):**
```javascript
// automation/brand-course.js
function applyTeneoBranding(genericCourse) {
  return {
    ...genericCourse,
    title: `Teneo ${genericCourse.title}`,
    subtitle: genericCourse.subtitle.replace('Book', 'Teneo Book'),
    description: genericCourse.description.replace('AI tools', 'Teneo'),
    instructor: {
      ...genericCourse.instructor,
      name: `Teneo ${genericCourse.instructor.name}`
    },
    tags: [...genericCourse.tags, 'Teneo']
  };
}

// When publishing to private Teneo platform
const brandedCourse = applyTeneoBranding(genericCourse);
```

### **Workflow:**
1. Create course content generically in `openbazaar-ai`
2. Copy to `teneo-production`
3. Apply branding script
4. Publish branded version to Teneo platform
5. Publish generic version to public marketplace

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth (generic version)
- Automatic branding when needed
- Easy to maintain both versions

## 📞 Questions?

**"Can I mention Teneo in examples?"**
- In documentation (like this file): Yes
- In course content: No, use "AI tools" instead

**"What if a lesson specifically teaches Teneo features?"**
- Keep that lesson in private repo
- Create generic equivalent for public repo
- OR make it a "bonus" lesson not in public version

**"Can partners add their own branding?"**
- Yes! That's the whole point of generic content
- They can fork and customize
- Just like you can with open source projects
