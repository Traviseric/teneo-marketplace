## ⚠️ What NOT to Contribute

**Please read**: [`docs/core/PUBLIC_REPO_GUIDELINES.md`](./docs/core/PUBLIC_REPO_GUIDELINES.md)

### **❌ Don't Add:**
- Proprietary content generation code
- Private API integrations (put in private repo)
- Secrets or API keys
- Large binary files (videos, large PDFs)
- Copyrighted content

### **✅ Do Add:**
- Generic UI/UX improvements

**Rule of Thumb**: If it's about **displaying** content → contribute here. If it's about **generating** content → that's for private repos.

## 🎯 Contribution Guidelines

### **Code Style**

**We keep it simple**:
- Use existing code style (see nearby files)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Good
async function getUserOrders(userId) {
  // Fetch orders for specific user
  const orders = await db.all(
    'SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?',
    [userId]
  );
  return orders;
}

// Less good
async function f(u) {
  let o = await db.all('SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?', [u]);
  return o;
}
```

**HTML/CSS**:
- Use semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`)
- Prefer CSS classes over inline styles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### **Commit Messages**

**Format**: `Type: Brief description`

**Types**:
- `Add:` New feature
- `Fix:` Bug fix
- `Update:` Improve existing feature
- `Remove:` Delete code/feature
- `Docs:` Documentation only
- `Refactor:` Code cleanup (no behavior change)
- `Test:` Add or update tests

**Examples**:
```
✅ Add: Ethereum payment support
✅ Fix: Cart total calculation on discount
✅ Update: Improve mobile navigation
✅ Docs: Add Stripe setup guide
❌ Updated stuff
❌ WIP
❌ fixes
```

### **Pull Requests**

**Title**: Same format as commit messages

**Description** should include:
- **What**: What does this PR do?
- **Why**: Why is this needed?
- **How**: How does it work? (if complex)
- **Testing**: How did you test it?

**Example**:
```markdown
## Add: Ethereum payment support

### What
Adds Ethereum as a payment option alongside Bitcoin.

### Why
Many users requested ETH support (#45, #67, #89)

### How
- Added ethers.js dependency
- Created EthereumProvider in payment/providers/
- Updated checkout flow to detect ETH addresses
- Added webhook handler for ETH confirmations

### Testing
- Tested on Sepolia testnet
- Verified address validation
- Confirmed webhook triggers correctly
- Manual testing: bought test product with testnet ETH

### Screenshots

## 🔍 Before Submitting

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows existing style
- [ ] Tested locally (works in browser)
- [ ] No console.log() left in code
- [ ] No secrets/API keys in code
- [ ] Comments added for complex logic
- [ ] Checked `docs/core/PUBLIC_REPO_GUIDELINES.md` for what to commit
- [ ] One feature per PR (not mixing multiple changes)

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Currently**: Manual testing (we don't have automated tests yet)

**How to Test**:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:3001`
3. Test your feature:
   - Create test account
   - Try all user flows
   - Test edge cases (empty cart, invalid input, etc.)
   - Test on mobile (Chrome DevTools responsive mode)
4. Check browser console for errors

**Future**: We plan to add Jest + Playwright. If you want to add tests, that's very welcome!
