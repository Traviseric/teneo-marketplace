# Teneo Engine Funnel Course: The 10x Strategy

## The Revolutionary Shift

### OLD Course Promise (Manual Building)
"Build a profitable book funnel in 7 days (20 hours of work)"

**Problems**:
- 20 hours is too much for busy authors
- Manual creation = inconsistent quality
- High failure rate (people give up halfway)
- Can't scale beyond 1 funnel

### NEW Course Promise (Teneo-Powered)
"**Generate** a complete funnel in 3 hours, spend the next 6.5 days **optimizing and scaling**"

**Advantages**:
- 85% time savings
- Consistent, high-quality output
- Higher completion rate (easier = less abandonment)
- Can generate multiple funnels for A/B testing
