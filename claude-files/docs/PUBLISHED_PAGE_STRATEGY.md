## üéñÔ∏è Why This Strategy Works

### 1. Proof Before Platform
Instead of building a marketplace and hoping publishers come, we're building the publisher network first with proof of success.

### 2. Data-Driven Development
Every book published gives us data on:
- What genres sell
- What titles work
- What covers convert
- What descriptions engage
- What price points optimize

### 3. Community-Led Growth
Publishers become stakeholders:
- They improve the product
- They bring other publishers
- They market their books (and Teneo)
- They have skin in the game

### 4. Open Source Advantage
By open-sourcing the marketplace:
- Developers contribute features
- Transparency builds trust
- Network effects accelerate
- Monopoly narrative strengthens

### 5. Progressive Decentralization
Start centralized for speed, gradually decentralize:
- **Phase 1**: Teneo hosts everything
- **Phase 2**: Publishers can self-host stores
- **Phase 3**: Fully decentralized network
- **Phase 4**: Blockchain-based ownership
