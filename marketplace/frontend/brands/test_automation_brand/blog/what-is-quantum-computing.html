      <h2>Introduction to Quantum Computing</h2>
      <p>Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.</p>

      <h3>What Makes Quantum Computers Different?</h3>
      <p>Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in superposition - simultaneously representing both 0 and 1.</p>

      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Superposition:</strong> The ability of qubits to be in multiple states at once</li>
        <li><strong>Entanglement:</strong> Quantum correlation between qubits</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Gates:</strong> Operations that manipulate qubit states</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
      <p>Quantum computers are being developed to solve problems in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drug discovery and molecular simulation</li>
        <li>Cryptography and cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Financial modeling and optimization</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</li>
      </ul>
