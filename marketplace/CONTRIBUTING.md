### Improving Documentation üìö

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This includes:

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We keep it simple and consistent:

#### JavaScript
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
function calculateDiscount(price, percentage) {
  if (percentage < 0 || percentage > 100) {
    throw new Error('Invalid percentage');
  }
  return price * (1 - percentage / 100);
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
function calc(p,perc){
  return p*(1-perc/100)
}
```

#### CSS
```css
/* ‚úÖ Good */
.book-card {
  display: flex;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background: white;
}

/* ‚ùå Avoid */
.book-card{display:flex;padding:1rem;border-radius:8px;background:white;}
```

#### General Rules
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Always use semicolons in JavaScript
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible

### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages that explain what and why:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good
git commit -m "Fix payment validation for international cards"
git commit -m "Add wishlist feature to user dashboard"
git commit -m "Update README with PostgreSQL setup instructions"

# ‚ùå Avoid
git commit -m "Fixed stuff"
git commit -m "Updates"
git commit -m "asdf"
```

Format:
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Keep under 72 characters
- Reference issues: "Fix payment bug (#123)"

Before submitting:

1. **Test manually** - Does it work as expected?
2. **Test edge cases** - What could go wrong?
