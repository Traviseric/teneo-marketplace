```

## Joining the Network

### Step 1: Enable Network Sharing

Add to your `.env`:

```env
# Federation Network
FEDERATION_ENABLED=true
FEDERATION_API_KEY=request-from-network
FEDERATION_STORE_ID=your-unique-store-id
FEDERATION_HUB_URL=https://federation.bookmarketplace.network
```

### Step 2: Register Your Store

```bash
curl -X POST https://federation.bookmarketplace.network/api/stores/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Your Bookstore",
    "url": "https://yourdomain.com",
    "description": "Specializing in tech books",
    "categories": ["technology", "programming"],
    "contact_email": "federation@yourdomain.com"
  }'
```

You'll receive:
- Store ID
- API key
- Webhook secret

### Step 3: Implement Federation Endpoints

#### Share Your Catalog

Create endpoint: `GET /api/federation/catalog`

```javascript
app.get('/api/federation/catalog', authenticateFederation, async (req, res) => {
  const books = await Book.findAll({
    where: { 
      available_for_federation: true,
      price: { [Op.gt]: 0 } // Only paid books
    },
    attributes: [
      'id', 'title', 'author', 'description', 
      'price', 'cover_url', 'preview_url'
    ],
    limit: 100
  });
  
  res.json({
    store_id: process.env.FEDERATION_STORE_ID,
    store_name: process.env.MARKETPLACE_NAME,
    books: books.map(book => ({
      ...book,
      federation_id: `${process.env.FEDERATION_STORE_ID}:${book.id}`,
      purchase_url: `${process.env.BASE_URL}/api/federation/purchase/${book.id}`
    }))
  });
});
```

#### Handle Referral Purchases

Create endpoint: `POST /api/federation/purchase/:bookId`

```javascript
app.post('/api/federation/purchase/:bookId', authenticateFederation, async (req, res) => {
  const { customer_email, referring_store_id } = req.body;
  
  // Process purchase
  const purchase = await processPurchase(bookId, customer_email);
  
  // Record referral
  await Referral.create({
    purchase_id: purchase.id,
    referring_store_id,
    commission_rate: 0.10,
    commission_amount: purchase.amount * 0.10
  });
  
  res.json({
    success: true,
    download_url: purchase.download_url,
    commission: purchase.amount * 0.10
  });
});
```

### Step 4: Display Network Books

#### Fetch Network Catalog

```javascript
async function fetchNetworkBooks() {
  const response = await fetch('https://federation.bookmarketplace.network/api/catalog', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${FEDERATION_API_KEY}`
    }
  });
  
  const { books } = await response.json();
  return books.filter(book => book.store_id !== OUR_STORE_ID);
}
```

#### Display in Your Store

```html
<section class="network-books">
  <h2>Books from Partner Stores</h2>
  <div class="network-notice">
    ðŸ“š These books are from partner stores in our network. 
    You'll be redirected to complete your purchase.
  </div>
  <div id="network-books-grid"></div>
</section>
```
