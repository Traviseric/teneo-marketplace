# Human Tasks — Teneo Marketplace

Items requiring human action (credentials, accounts, external services, business decisions).
These cannot be completed autonomously.

- [ ] [HT-001] CREATE .env FILE — Copy `marketplace/backend/.env.example` to `.env`. Set real values for: `SESSION_SECRET` (random 64-char string), `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (run `node marketplace/backend/scripts/generate-password-hash.js --generate`), `DATABASE_PATH`, and Stripe test keys (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). — Reason: Contains credentials, must be done by human in secure environment
- [ ] [HT-002] CONFIGURE SMTP FOR EMAILS — Set `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env` with real SMTP credentials (SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar). Without this, magic link auth emails and order confirmations won't send. — Reason: Requires account setup and credential management
- [ ] [HT-003] CONFIGURE CRYPTO WALLET ADDRESSES — Set `BTC_ADDRESS`, `LTC_ADDRESS`, `XMR_ADDRESS` in `.env` with real wallet addresses for crypto payments. Current fallback is 'CONFIGURE' placeholder. — Reason: Requires wallet setup by operator
- [ ] [HT-004] STRIPE KEY VERIFICATION — Verify Stripe publishable key is set in environment and matches the secret key (same account, both test or both live). Once task 008 is complete, the frontend will load the key dynamically — human must ensure it's set correctly. — Reason: Financial account credentials
- [ ] [HT-005] DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION — After P0/P1 fixes are complete, deploy the updated server. If using Render, trigger a new deploy. If using Docker, rebuild the image. — Reason: Production deployment access required
- [ ] [HT-006] ROTATE LEAKED TENEO_CLIENT_SECRET — The production OAuth client secret `[REDACTED]` is committed to the public `.env.example` file (line 96) and explicitly documented as "the actual production secret for official TENEO Marketplace." Steps: (1) Immediately rotate/revoke this secret in the OAuth provider (Teneo Auth admin panel), (2) Replace the value in `.env.example` with a placeholder like `your-client-secret-here`, (3) Remove the comment saying it's the actual production secret, (4) Rewrite git history to remove the secret: `git filter-repo --path .env.example --invert-paths` or use BFG Repo Cleaner, (5) Force-push to remote and notify all collaborators to re-clone. — Reason: Credential rotation requires account access to OAuth provider; git history rewriting requires repo admin access and coordination with all contributors
