# INTERFACE SPECIFICATION - Standard for Sovereignty Infrastructure

## Purpose

This document defines the standard format for creating interface specifications across the sovereignty infrastructure ecosystem. Every project should have an `INTERFACE_[PROJECT_NAME].md` file that allows other systems to understand and connect to it.

## File Naming Convention

```
INTERFACE_[PROJECT_NAME].md
```

Examples:
- `INTERFACE_TRAVIS_ERIC.md` (master specification)
- `INTERFACE_TENEO.md`
- `INTERFACE_LIBERTY.md`
- `INTERFACE_PROFILEENGINE.md`
- `INTERFACE_CONVERSOS.md`

## Standard Template

## Creating Instructions

### For New Projects

1. **Copy the template** from this specification
2. **Replace all [bracketed] placeholders** with your project details
3. **Name the file** `INTERFACE_[YOUR_PROJECT].md`
4. **Place in project root** alongside README.md
5. **Update regularly** as the project evolves

### For Existing Projects

1. **Audit current documentation** - README, API docs, contribution guides
2. **Extract information** into the standard template format
3. **Add missing sections** - especially sovereignty principles and integration patterns
4. **Rename and restructure** existing docs if needed
5. **Cross-reference** with other interface docs for consistency

### Quality Checklist

Before publishing your interface specification:

- [ ] All [bracketed] placeholders replaced
- [ ] API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Sovereignty principles clearly stated
- [ ] Integration examples provided
- [ ] Contact and collaboration info current
- [ ] Brand assets and colors specified
- [ ] Anti-patterns clearly defined
- [ ] Connection template provided

## Key Principles

### 1. Sovereignty First
Every interface spec must explain:
- What prison this breaks
- How users maintain ownership
- Exit strategies built-in
- Anti-surveillance measures

### 2. Integration Ready
Provide:
- Working code examples
- Clear API documentation
- Webhook specifications
- Rate limits and usage

### 3. Brand Consistent
Include:
- Color schemes
- Typography choices
- Voice and tone guidelines
- Visual asset locations

### 4. Community Focused
Document:
- How to contribute
- Communication preferences
- Collaboration standards
- Support channels

## Example Usage

```bash
# Creating interface spec for new project
cp INTERFACE_TEMPLATE.md INTERFACE_MYPROJECT.md
# Edit file with project details
# Place in project root
# Link from README.md
```

## Integration Testing

After creating your interface specification:

1. **Test with another project** - Can someone else integrate using only your spec?
2. **Verify examples work** - Do all code examples execute successfully?
3. **Check sovereignty alignment** - Does it maintain user ownership?
4. **Review accessibility** - Is it clear and complete?

## Living Documents

Interface specifications should be:
- **Updated with every major release**
- **Reviewed quarterly** for accuracy
- **Cross-referenced** with other project interfaces
- **Used as integration contracts** between systems

---

## Connection Template

When integrating with any sovereignty infrastructure project:

```yaml
integration_checklist:
  - [ ] Read their INTERFACE_[PROJECT].md
  - [ ] Verify sovereignty alignment
  - [ ] Test API endpoints
  - [ ] Implement webhook handlers
  - [ ] Follow brand guidelines
  - [ ] Document the integration
  - [ ] Provide exit strategies
```

*This specification enables sovereignty infrastructure to connect seamlessly while maintaining user ownership and system integrity.*

**Standard**: Use this format for all sovereignty infrastructure projects
