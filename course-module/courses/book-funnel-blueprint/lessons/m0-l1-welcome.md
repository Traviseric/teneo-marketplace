# Welcome: Why Most Book Funnels Fail

## The Brutal Truth About Book Marketing in 2025

You wrote a book. Maybe with Teneo in 3 days, maybe the traditional way over 6 months. Either way, you hit "publish" and...

**Crickets.**

Here's what nobody tells you:

> **Writing the book is 10% of the work. Marketing it is 90%.**

## Why Traditional Book Funnels Fail

Most authors make these fatal mistakes:

### ❌ Mistake #1: "Build it and they will come"
**Reality**: There are 4 million books on Amazon. Yours is invisible without a funnel.

### ❌ Mistake #2: "I'll just run some Facebook ads"
**Reality**: Ads without a funnel = burning money. $500 spent, 3 books sold, $45 revenue. Ouch.

### ❌ Mistake #3: "I need a website first"
**Reality**: A $5,000 website with 0% conversion rate is worthless. A simple landing page at 5% conversion prints money.

### ❌ Mistake #4: "Email marketing is dead"
**Reality**: Email converts at 3-5x higher than social media. Your list is your gold mine.

## What Actually Works

A properly built funnel turns **1,000 visitors** into:
- 30-50 email subscribers (3-5% conversion)
- 5-10 book sales immediately (through sequence)
- 2-3 backend sales (if you have coaching/courses)

**Math**:
- Ad spend: $300 (at $10 CPM, ~$0.30 per click)
- Book revenue: $150 (10 sales × $15 avg)
- Backend revenue: $1,500-$3,000 (2-3 × $500-1000)
- **ROI: 5-10x**

## Your Unfair Advantage: The Teneo Multiplier

Traditional authors spend:
- 6-12 months writing
- 2-3 months editing
- 1 month launching

**One book per year.**

You with Teneo:
- 3-5 days creating
- 1-2 weeks refining
- 1 week launching

**10-15 books per year.**

### What This Means

- 1 book = Author
- 3 books = Expert
- 10 books = Authority

**You can build authority 10x faster than traditional authors.**
